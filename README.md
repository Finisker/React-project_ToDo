# ToDo web application

This project was created so I can learn the basics of React.\
I used functional components, hooks, conditional rendering, props, and callbacks in the project.

I expanded the project and used a local file to mock up a database.\
I did that to learn about REST API and `useEffect` hooks.

The project is deployed on Render. \
For that, I put my app inside a client folder and created a server.json file.

# How does it look?
