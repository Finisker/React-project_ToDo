# ToDo web application

This project was created so I can learn the basics of React.\
I used functional components, hooks, conditional rendering, props, and callbacks in the project.

'render-deploy' is a branch that Render uses for deployment.\
'json-server' is a branch you can run locally with json-server.\
'master' is a branch I have no idea what is on :P (probably same as 'json-server')
